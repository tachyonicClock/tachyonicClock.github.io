The game was a short stealth game where you played as a ball of light running away from dementor like creatures. It was our first unity project and as such lacks a lot of polish and is a little buggy. I think the mood and the ambiance are the aspects that turned out best in the game.</description></item><item><title>Mad</title><link>https://antonjameslee.com/projects/mad/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 14:14:38 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://antonjameslee.com/projects/mad/</guid><description>Mad was one of my earliest large projects. It was coded in C# using windows forms which led to interesting challenges to get the graphics I wanted. All of the graphics were created by me. I used illustrator for the Icons, Photoshop for the map and Blender for the rockets and explosions.
The given brief was to create an educational game. I decided I would educate people about mutually assured destruction.</description></item></channel></rss>
